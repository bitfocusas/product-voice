Think of a "voice" as a unique person guiding or cueing a group of people. You can create up to 10 voices, and each can speak a different language. You have the option to create a single voice for everyone to keep it simple or assign different voices for each separate group of people. Each voice requires a separate audio channel or output, ensuring that a person hears only one voice at a time.

The first voice will represent the main language used in the project. If you add other languages, the text will automatically be translated. Always review the translations to ensure there are no potential misunderstandings. Translations are conducted using the Google Translate API.

You can select between three different scripting-modes
-Simple
-Seconds
-Bars

#### Simple-mode

In this mode the voice will read out the statements at the exact time of the timecode.

#### Seconds

In this mode, the voice will count down to the exact time of the statement and repeat the text in advance to ensure everyone knows what is coming.

#### Bars

Similar to seconds mode, this mode counts down in bars instead. It's more musical and often preferred when working with music. Remember to set the correct BPM (beats per minute) for the song for this to work as expected.

Each voice can have a different mode to allow the receiver to use their preferred method of preview.
