Voice is here to releave you of all your cuing load when working with timecode shows.

Many touring productions and others alike cue shows manually or record the cues and adds them to your tracks-playback system to keep everyone on track with whats coming up. The process can be tedious and not very flexible. Bitfocus Voice takes your timecode and your cues, and distributes them to your team verbally just like you would have done it yourself.

The system consists of 3 parts:

- A computer running Voice
- An audio input, which receives LTC (Linear Timecode)
- One or more audio outputs, routed to anyone who needs to hear the cues. Band, Crew, Pyro, Lighting, etc.
