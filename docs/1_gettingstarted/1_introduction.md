Voice is here to relieve you of all the burdens of cueing when working with timecode shows.

Many touring productions, and others alike, cue shows manually or record the cues and add them to their track playback system to keep everyone on track with what's coming up. The process can be tedious and not very flexible. Bitfocus Voice takes your timecode and cues, and distributes them verbally to your team just as if you were doing it yourself.

The system consists of three parts:

- A computer running Voice
- An audio input that receives LTC (Linear Timecode)
- One or more audio outputs routed to anyone who needs to hear the cues: band, crew, pyro, lighting, etc.
